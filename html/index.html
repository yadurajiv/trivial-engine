				<h1>Keep it Trivial, Stupid!</h1>
				<p class="lead">Trivial Engine is our solution to global warming, terrorism, poverty, racism and other world problems. We want to make the act of <abbr title="from a new, crazy idea to a working proof of concept, which you can then push forward into a working game">prototyping new game ideas</abbr> so simple and uncomplicated - so trivial, that anyone, yes anyone, can make games.</p>

						<h4>From Complex to Trivial</h4>
						<p>The key focus of the complete framework is to make complex subsystems easier to manage and build for: we have an accessible camera system, an image manager, font manager, audio manager, event manager,  and other resource managers<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>
						<p>The event manager lets you subscribe any object to a huge range of system or custom events. The camera systems exposes trivial functions to simplify look-ats and camera movements<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The engine smartly uses spritesheets to work with animations. The engine can create multilayered maps with tilemaps<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>An advanced 2d rendering system that exposes sprites to image blending and a multi-layered scene with parallax effect<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="span6">
						<h4>Nifty tools are built right in</h4>
						<p>The engine has a range of nifty tools built right in. These take care of those subtle, routine things that developers dont think much of<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>
						<p>There is a tool that captures screenshots from the game, another that captures video and audio from the game and saves it to the disk<span class="label label-important">planned for release</span></p>
						<p>The engine also includes a complete GUI class that includes labels, label manipulation, buttons, range of input types. The system also supports custom fonts<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>

						<h4>Made for Speed</h4>
						<p>We dont call it Trivial for no reason: getting started and getting an app up and running is as simple as a writing two function calls<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The engine works with hardware accelerated audio and video allowing you to squeeze out that performance for your game. Different resource managers efficiently handle memory and resources, allowing you to scale up to thousands of sprites in a single scene<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>
						<p>System configuration is a simple XML based system with rapid turnaround processes<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The engine exposes simple translation and manipulation functions for working with sprites and basic physics<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The audio manager extends streaming support and looping tracks and allows to manipulate and transform sound with exposed information like sample rates, channel counts, playing position and actual sample data through single function calls<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
					</div>
					<div class="span6">
						<h4>Many Platforms, Many Choices</h4>
						<p>Easily develop and deploy for Windows, Mac and Linux. Trivial Engine is proud to be cross-platform and it will reach out to newer platforms in future<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The engine supports a range of input devices<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>The engine exposes tonnes of Helper classes and functions for all of its built-in objects in a thorough object-oriented universe<span class="label label-success">implemented</span></p>
						<p>We support a huge range of image, audio, video, fonts and resource formats. Data interchange goes through XMLs and JSON is coming soon. If there is a format worth using, we support it!<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>

						<h4>Social from the Go</h4>
						<p>Trivial Engine is part of the Trivial Stack and is completely integrated with Trivial Analytics and Sense right out of the box<span class="label label-important">planned for release</span></p>
						<p>There is an extensive Network manager that will make a client/server system easy to deploy and also extend an easy to use IRC client system<span class="label label-important">planned for release</span></p>
					</div>

					<div class="span6">
						<h4>Easy to find your way Around</h4>
						<p>With Trivial Engine, you dont have to stumble around in developer hell. The engine is heavily documented in an extensive documentation built with Doxygen<span class="label label-warning">in development</span></p>
						<p>It also comes with detailed examples and demos explainging every feature and tool in the engine<span class="label label-important">planned for release</span></p>

				<a name="access">&nbsp;</a>
				<p>We are working hard to get a public release schedule ready for the Trivial Engine. We need your help to do so quickly.</p>
				<p>We will <abbr title="undefined, uncertain, maybe near future">soon</abbr> have the engine ready in a state where it can be actively used in a production pipeline and we want you to use it and tell us how you like the engine, and what you would like to be improved in the engine.</p>
				<p>It will also give us insights in how the Trivial Engine adopts to your development cycles and processes, and how we can make that integration smoother.</p>
				<p>If that sounds interesting to you, all we ask for is your email address below. We promise not to <abbr title="only some occassional updates about the project, s'il vous pla&icirc;t">spam!</abbr></p>
